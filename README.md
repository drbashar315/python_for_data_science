# python_for_data_science
This repo will store and describe the essential python techniques that are super useful for any data analysis project.

The techniques documented here are taken from my academic learning as well as from the lessons learnt during various projects.

There would be one pythone notebook file (.ipynb) for one topic. Each of the notebook files will be named after its topic, with a serial nubmber as a prefix. 

For each topic, one or more technique(s) will be documented with codes and examples.
