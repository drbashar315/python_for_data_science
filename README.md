# python_for_data_science
This repo will store some python techniques that would be super useful for any data analysis project.
There would be one pythone notebook file (.ipynb) for one topic.
For each topic one or more techniques will be documented with codes and examples.
Each of the python notebook file names would be prefixed by a number that can be considered as an index value.
